# Methods

public means anyone can use it
static means there's one set that everyone can use

_Formal parameters_ are what you call the variables you define that the methods takes: int test(int i, int j);
_Actual parameters_ are what you call the variables that the methods actually takes.
Visibility modifiers are the "adjectives" in front of the function: public/private static
